# Maze Solver

This is the result of a guided project from [boot.dev](https://boot.dev) called "Build a Maze Solver."

This project creates a randomly generated maze, and it solves the maze using a depth-first-search algorithm. I plan on extending this at some point, probably turn it into a game.

## Dependencies

This was creating using Python 3.12 and Tkinter.

## Install

With Python and Tkinter ready, clone the repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/sytallax/maze-solver
```

## Running

In its current form, the program creates a GUI window, draws a maze on it, and solves it. Run `maze.py`. A `tests.py` is included, which contains unit tests. This one isn't as important.
